            <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
            <p>My greatest passion is music. I have a cover band called Full House, and you can follow our project on <a href="https://www.fb.com/FullHouseCBand" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and Instagram at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fullhousecband" target="_blank">@fullhousecband</a>.</p>
            <p>I usually perform on weekends at events where we can already see a monetary gain. Additionally, I have an upcoming performance on October 13th at the Javier Barros Sierra Auditorium at the Faculty of Engineering.</p>
            <p>I also love listening to music. I dedicate a lot of time to it, not so much to watching TV series or movies. I tend to explore various genres and immerse myself in them.</p>

            <h2>5G Advanced and 6G</h2>
            <p>5G Advanced is an evolution of the existing 5G network technology. It aims to enhance the capabilities of 5G with faster speeds, lower latency, and improved connectivity, paving the way for more advanced applications like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).</p>
            <p>6G, on the other hand, is the next generation of wireless technology. While it's still in the early stages of development, it is expected to provide even faster speeds, near-instantaneous communication, and support for groundbreaking technologies like holographic communication and advanced AI applications.</p>
